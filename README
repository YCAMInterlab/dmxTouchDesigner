I wrote this dmxTouchDesigner in November 2011 as part of an internship at the Yamaguchi Center for Arts and Media and funded by Arts SA Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi Travel Fund. 

This code uses the Touch Designer CPLUSPLUS CHOP example code along with the 

Enttec Open DMX USB

Touch Designer CPLUSPLUS
http://derivative.ca/wiki077/index.php?title=Write_a_CPlusPlus_DLL

The purpose of this code is to enable direct communication between Touch Designer and Enttec DMX Pro USB. It's meant to be built as a dll and loaded into Touch Designer's CPLUSPLUS CHOP operator. When loaded into touch the dll will automatically initialise the Enttec and a light will start blinking on the device.

IDE - Microsoft Visual c++ 2010

Once built and loaded into Touch Designer -

CHOP inputs
Input 1 = DMX channels (limit of 512)
Input 2 = DMX values (corresponding to the DMX channels)

Floats page (1st row)
value 1 = the device number (usually 0)
value 2 = turn the device on and off (there should be a little pause when you turn it on)

Floats page (2nd row)
value 1 = the number of channels you are sending.
